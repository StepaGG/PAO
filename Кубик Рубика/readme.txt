This is the first major project I have undertaken with solidworks.  It is a complete reconstruction of a Rubik's Cube with ALL components included.  I realize that I haven't constructed everything using the most efficient methods possible but I hope to do better later on. 
Anyway, through the use of some complicated mating (in my opinion) I have assembled the model so that it can be expanded to show all of the internal parts.  Just highlight any of the pieces in the centre of a side and drag outwards.  While this may work for some of the other pieces as well, my intention for this version was just to enable this feature, not to implement it completely.  While I may complete this in the future, I'll probably just leave it as is, so if anyone else out there wants to do this, feel free (Although I would appreciate it if you would let me know and send me the finished result.)
